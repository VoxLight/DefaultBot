# Default Bot


# About
This is a default bot which you can have to develop cogs.
This bot is simple in it's use. Simply add your token into config and run bot.py.

Adding cogs is easy, follow the outline of the ./cogs/basic.py cog for a template.

Simply add a new cog into the cogs folder and the bot will automatically add it when it's launched.

Additionally, cog_manager adds functionalities of loading/unloading cogs so you don't have to restart the bot every time.
